1. "Fit Data"
Fits averaged kinetics in the chosen time range (see "Start Time For Arbitrary Part / mcs" and "End Time For Arbitrary Part / mcs" options). After fitting, shows obtained results (fit, fit residuals, parameter table, model, description). 
There are three models:
ZL + A1*Exp(-t/T1)		  		   - One Exponential model; ZL (a.u.), A1 (a.u.), T1 (mcs) - fit parameters; 
ZL + A1*Exp(-t/T1) + A2*Exp(-t/T2) - Two Exponential model; ZL (a.u.), A1 (a.u.), T1 (mcs), A2, T2 - fit parameters;

All of them are fitted at the same time.
! Kinetics are averaged (summed and divided by their total number) in the chosen magnetic field range (see "Start Field For Averaging / G" and "End Field For Averaging / G" options).
! Sometimes the initial values of the fit parameters have to be manually changed (see options 1-6), in order to help in converging the least-square fitting.
